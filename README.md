# BT_2Wheeler_car

ESP32 based bt_2wheeler car is an open-source project that aims to build a bluetooth-controlled, two-wheeled car using the ESP32 microcontroller.
The project is still under development, but it has the potential to be a fun and educational project for people of all ages.

To build the car, you will need the following components:

ESP32 microcontroller
Two motor drivers
Two motors
Battery
Bluetooth module
Chassis
Wheels

One of the things that I like most about the ESP32 based bt_2wheeler car is that it is open-source.
This means that you can access the project's files and modify them to your liking.
You can also use the project as a starting point for your own projects.
Another thing that I like about the ESP32 based bt_2wheeler car is that it is relatively inexpensive to build. 
All of the components that you need are readily available online and at most electronics stores.
If you are looking for a fun and educational project to build, I highly recommend the ESP32 based bt_2wheeler car. It is a great way to learn about electronics, programming, and robotics.
